      // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      // STRINGS, NUMBERS, AND BOOLEANS copy their value from assignament
      let age = 100;
      let age2 = age; //COPY THE VALUE
      console.log(age, age2); // 100, 100

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a "copy" of it.
      const team = players; // THIS IS A REFERANCE TO THE ARRAY!!

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[3] = "Daniel"; // MODIFY players TOO BECAUSE IS A REFERENCE!
      // however what happens when we update that array?
      // now here is the problem!
      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice(); // THIS IS A COPY!!
      const team3 = [].concat(players); // THIS IS A COPY!!
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players]; // THIS IS A COPY!!

      const team5 = Array.from(players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      team2[2] = "Daniel";
      team3[2] = "Daniel";
      team4[2] = "Daniel";
      team5[2] = "Daniel";
      //ORIGINAL IS UNTOUCHED IN ALL OF THEM

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80
      };

      // and think we make a "copy":
      const captain = person; // THIS IS A REFERENCE
      captain.number = 99; // THIS CHANGES THE ORIGINAL

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 }); // THIS IS A COPY. We added prop number and reassign age
      //ORIGINAL IS UNTOUCHED

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const cap3 = { ...person };
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
      // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      const wes = {
        name: "Wes",
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: "@wesbos",
          facebook: "wesbos.developer"
        }
      };

      console.clear();
      console.log(wes);

      // 1 Lvl copy, the rest are references.
      const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

      // Hacky Way to get deep clone wes => String => Obj
      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
